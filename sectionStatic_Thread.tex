\section{Static Thread Pool Optimization}
\label{sec:staticopt}

This section addresses RQ2.

Based on the observed GC throughput behavior in the previous section,
we think that optimization based on \emph{curve fitting} for GC throughput 
is a possible technique.
We will fit the curve $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ where 
$y$ is GC throughput and 
$x$ is number of GC threads.
Figure \ref{fig:staticopt:h2} shows the fitted quadratic curves for 
the Dacapo/h2 benchmark. We use SPSS to do the fitting.
Once we have the parameters for the quadratic equation, we can 
differentiate to compute the location of the turning point on the parabola.
This indicates the statically optimum number of GC threads.
Note that a single workload will have two optimum number of GC threads---one for minor and one for major GCs.
Table \ref{tab:staticopt:values} gives the computed optimum values for the
number of minor and major GC threads for each benchmark.

These results show that there is a definite turning point on each graph---if 
the number of GC threads increases beyond a threshold value, then GC 
performance degrades. 
We may observe that this threshold value is \emph{different}
for minor and major GCs, and for different benchmarks. 
The value may even vary during different phases of execution, although
we do not measure this.

We use the Likwid \cite{treibig10likwid} profiling tool
to measure hardware performance counters related to NUMA traffic.
Figure \ref{fig:congestion:likwid} shows the absolute counter values for
complete executions of the benchmarks, with fixed numbers of
GC threads. In some cases (particularly jython and pmd) it is possible 
to see clear minima in NUMA traffic, indicating 
configuration sweet-spots in terms of the number of GC threads.

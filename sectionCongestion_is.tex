\section{Congestion is a Problem}
\label{sec:congestion}

This section addresses RQ1.

For each workload, we measure GC throughput using a fixed number of 
GC threads.
Throughput is calculated as size of collected heap space divided by wall clock time of GC.
For each (workload, GC threads) combination, we take 20 measurements and
report arithmetic mean. All error bars on graphs show one standard deviation 
either side of the mean.
We measure minor and major GC throughputs separately, since they have entirely
different characteristics. The minor GC is a copying collector, whereas the
major GC is compacting mark/sweep.
Figures \ref{fig:congestion:minorgc} and \ref{fig:congestion:majorgc}
show throughputs for minor and major GC respectively, when the JVM is
configured to run on 32 cores.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

In the same way that JVM heap size is subject to a 
complex dynamic tuning system based on 
feedback control, we argue that the number of GC threads should 
have a similar runtime tuning system.

We have shown that the number of GC threads has a significant impact on
application performance. NUMA machines are particularly sensitive to GC 
multi-threading, due to NUMA congestion issues.
We observe that the optimum number of GC threads varies by GC type and
application workload.
We have shown the potential for adaptive tuning using a simple search-based
optimization technique.

The final version of this paper will include a link to a github repo with
code and data for our experiments.

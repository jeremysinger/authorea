\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:threats}

We see two main threats to the validity of our experiments.

\subsection{Lack of Generality}
We only perform experiments on one NUMA system. We only use a single 
virtual machine implementation.
It is possible that these empirical behaviors might be artifacts of the
evaluation platform. To mitigate this, it is necessary to perform
the same experiments on other platforms and compare the results.
We consider our range of benchmarks to be representative
and moderately broad.

\subsection{Causality}
The observed NUMA congestion issue might be caused by an underlying
problem, e.g.\ contended memory manager locks.
We could test this by repeating our experiments with another JVM implementation,
or another language runtime.
Further, we could check to see whether HotSpot has similar multi-threading 
GC performance issues on multicore UMA platforms.

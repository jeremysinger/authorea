\section{Hotspot GC Thread Management}

The Hotspot JVM allows the user to set the number of parallel GC threads
via a command-line parameter\footnote{\url{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/java.html}}.
When the number of GC threads is set explicitly at VM startup in this way,
the number of GC threads remains \emph{constant} throughout every GC cycle, 
for both minor and major collections.

HotSpot also has support for \emph{adaptive} GC thread management.
This policy changes the number of GC threads, if required, at every GC cycle.
Anecdotally, common practice reveals that engaging the full system resources to the garbage collection yields suboptimal performance\footnote{
\url{http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/hotspot-gc-dev/2009-January/000718.html}}.
Therefore, the Hotspot JVM sets a maximum number of collection threads $M$ using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
M = 8 + \big((P-8) * \frac{5}{8}\big)
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the number of processors.
For example, if a system has 32 cores then the maximum number of GC threads is 23.

We evaluate this static optimum GC thread configuration, by patching the JVM
to allow different fixed thread settings for minor and major GC.
Then we compare the computed static optimum configuration against default
HotSpot adaptive behavior.
Figure \ref{fig:staticopt:compare:gc} shows the GC time for various
workloads with these policies. In all cases, the static optimum GC configuration
is significantly better than the HotSpot default configuration.
Figure \ref{fig:staticopt:compare:vm} shows the overall application
execution time for the same workloads. 
In the majority of cases, the static optimum GC configuration leads to significantly better execution times than the HotSpot default configuration.
